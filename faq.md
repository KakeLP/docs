#FAQ

###I am not queer, can I attend an event?

No, this group is intended for people who self-identify under the umbrella term 'queer'.

###Do I count as queer?

We take the term 'queer' as a very broad concept and we do not quiz attendees about how the term applies to them. It is really down to your individual judgment about whether you feel this word applies to you. Given that queer is such an umbrella term, if you are in doubt the answer is probably yes.

###I have only just started coding, can I attend?

Yes!
