### Photo policy

We want to get more queer coders excited about us! What better way to show them than by having some photos up so they can see what itâ€™s like at our meetups.

We have an opt-in photo system whereby we ask event attendees to use a coloured nametag instead of a plain nametag if they are okay with being in photos.

We will not take photographs of people who do not have a coloured nametag.

If you are in one of our published photos and you are not happy, please feel free to tell the organisers and we will stop using it.

This is our first photo policy and we are open to feedback on how to improve it!
