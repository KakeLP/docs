Our next event will be [Lunch & Code: Chrome DevTools Workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/239058818/) on **22nd April**. This Saturday event will feature a morning talk/workshop on using Chrome's built in DevTools given by our very own Googler! As usual there will be food and time for socialising.

Keep an eye on the Queer Code London meetup page, as we'll be announcing our next few events over the coming weeks.

### Help wanted!

We could use some help in running this meetup. If any of the following interests you, please contact us:

- **Social Media** – promoting us on Facebook and/or Twitter
- **Design** – designing a logo
- **Events** – giving a talk, recommending a speaker, discussion topic ideas, lightning talks of just a few minutes
- **Social events** – finding locations, coming up with ideas, hosting and welcoming people
- **Sponsors** – companies who can provide space and/or sponsor food and drink or social events, we would need someone from the company to be at each event they host

If you want to help out with something else that is not listed, let us know!

### Welfare

Please get in touch with Sam (@onlyskin on Slack) if you have any issues / concerns / anxiety about anything to do with Queer Code London that you’d like to raise safely and/or privately with the group or organisers.

We are starting a buddy scheme. This is available to anyone who wants to come to an event and would feel more comfortable meeting someone friendly before the event. If you would like to use the buddy scheme, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/buddy.md) and submit an email with the specified information. We will do our best to arrange someone to meet with you before the event.

### Thanks to our sponsors

We want to say thank you to 8th Light and Unruly for hosting us this month, and providing the space and food/drinks for our meetups. Thanks also to JetBrains for providing us with IDE licenses to raffle at our events.
