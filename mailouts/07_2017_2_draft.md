### News!

#### Lunch & Code becomes a regular
Our Saturday Lunch & Code events are now officially a regular event! We've settled on the **third Saturday of the month** to be our reliable Lunch & Code date, so block out your calendars for the rest of the year!!

#### Accessible venue search
Queer Code London is on the lookout for an accessible Saturday venue! Our current Lunch & Code venue is unfortunately only accessible by stairs. Please get in touch with us if you and your workplace would be happy to host Queer Code London on a Saturday daytime. We'd love to hear from you even if you can only host for a single event!

#### Website
We've been working on some Queer Code London pages for the website - if you want to get involved, hit up the #website channel on [Slack](https://slackinvite-qcldn.herokuapp.com/)!

#### Non Binary in Tech
Queer Code will be attending [Non Binary in Tech](https://nonbinary.tech/) on Saturday, 29th July (the weekend after next). NBiT is a **free** conference run by one of our members that focuses on highlighting the amazing work of people who identify partly or solely outside of the gender binary in the technology industry.

#### DevOpsDays London **free conference tickets**

Our next event will be a social in Soho this Friday, 21st July. The location and meetup event will be announced nearer the time, and we'd love to see as many people as possible!

The weekend after next, on Saturday 29th July we'll be taking a group of Queer Coders to [Non Binary in Tech](https://nonbinary.tech/), a conference organised by one of our members that highlights the amazing work of people who identify partly or solely outside of the gender binary in the technology industry!

We've also settled on a regular date for our Lunch & Code's, so save the date for the third Saturday in August - 19th August for our next Lunch & Code, topic to be announced!

### Help wanted!

We could use some help in running this meetup. If any of the following interests you, please contact us:

- **Social Media** – promoting via Facebook or Twitter, designing a logo
- **Events** – giving a talk, recommending a speaker, discussion topic ideas, lightning talks of just a few minutes
- **Social events** – finding locations, coming up with ideas, hosting and welcoming people
- **Sponsors** – companies who can provide space and/or sponsor food and drink or social events, we would need someone from the company to be at each event they host
- **Accessible Saturday Venue** – we're looking for an accessible venue to host our monthly Lunch & Code event on a Saturday, please get in touch if you can host, even just for one occasion!
- **Buddy Volunteers** – we're always looking for people happy to be buddies to new members, if you'd like to volunteer, read our criteria [here](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/buddy.md), and join #buddy-scheme on [Slack](https://slackinvite-qcldn.herokuapp.com/)!

### Welfare

Please get in touch with Sam (@onlyskin on Slack) if you have any issues / concerns / anxiety about anything to do with Queer Code London that you’d like to raise safely and/or privately with the group or organisers.

### Buddy Scheme

We run a buddy scheme. This is available to anyone who wants to come to an event and would feel more comfortable meeting someone friendly before the event. If you would like to use the buddy scheme, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/buddy.md) and submit an email with the specified information. We will do our best to arrange someone to meet with you before the event.

### Photo policy

We want to get more queer coders excited about us! What better way to show them than by having some photos up so they can see what it’s like at our meetups. We will dedicate one person for the next few meetups to take some photos.

We have a special marker for nametags if you are okay with being in photos (this is an opt-in system).

If you are in one of our published photos and you are not happy, please feel free to tell the organisers and we will stop using it. This is our first photo policy and we are open to feedback on how to improve it!

### Thanks to our sponsors

We want to say thank you to Pivotal Labs, ThoughtWorks, Gamesys, and 8th Light for hosting us this month, and for providing the space and food/drinks for our meetups. Thanks also to JetBrains for providing us with IDE licenses to raffle at our events.
