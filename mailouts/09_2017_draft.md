### News!

#### Organiser Buddy Scheme

Queer Code London is trialing a new type of Buddy Scheme - the Organiser Buddy Scheme! If you'd like to help out by organising an event but
would feel more comfortable doing it with someone else who has previously organised events, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/organiser_buddy.md)
and submit an email with your information and one of the organisers will get in touch to help you figure out which event you could help organise.

#### Laptop Stickers

We are in the process of getting Queer Code London laptop stickers! We've got a logo for our slack, but we're considering how we can improve it before we get stickers printed – if you have
design skills and would be interested in helping improve the logo, please get in touch, we could use a professional eye.

#### New Breakfast Time

Our upcoming [Breakfast & Catch-up](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/243064216/) event on 3rd October is going to be starting at the later time of 8:00 am, please feel free
to get in touch with feedback about whether you like this time better or worse.

#### Hashtag

The word is getting out more and more about Queer Code London, if you tweet about us, go ahead and use the hashtag #qcldn to spread the word.

### Upcoming events

Our next event is this Thursday: [Bites & Bytes](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/243311367/). This is our first event at MOO, and will feature 
talks from Meri Williams, MOO's CTO, and Jo Pearce, a member of Queer Code London.

Saturday of this week is the [CaBiRet Social](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/242486979/). We will be going to see CaBiRet – a fabulous evening of bisexual cabaret at the Cavendish Arms in Stockwell.

Next is a day of [Queer Coworking](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/242432941/) at TechHub on Monday, 25th September. This is the second coworking daytime event, following on from the success of the last one.

On Thursday, 28th September we have our very first Lightning Talks session - [Rainbows & Lightning](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/242437220/). Members of Queer Code London have
volunteered to give short lightning talks on a topic of their choice. No pressure to speak - we need an audience for the talks as well! This event will be hosted by Makers Academy, and will be our
first time there.

Tuesday, 3rd October sees our now regular Breakfast event at Pivotal: [Breakfast & Catch-up](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/243064216/). Please note that the start time for the event
is now 8:00 am.

The social for October is going to be at Loading Bar in Stoke Newington on Friday, 6th October: [Boardgames Social - Round 4!](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/243398142/)

This time there are two save-the-dates, one for Saturday, 21st October for the October Lunch & Code, and one for 18th November, for our Global Day of Coderetreat event which is in the works.

### Welfare

Please get in touch with Sam (@onlyskin on Slack) if you have any issues / concerns / anxiety about anything to do with Queer Code London that you’d like to raise safely and/or privately with the group or organisers.

### Buddy Scheme

We run a buddy scheme. This is available to anyone who wants to come to an event and would feel more comfortable meeting someone friendly before the event. If you would like to use the buddy scheme, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/buddy.md) and submit an email with the specified information. We will do our best to arrange someone to meet with you before the event.

### Organiser Buddy Scheme

Given the success of the regular buddy scheme, Queer Code London is trialing a new type of Buddy Scheme - the Organiser Buddy Scheme! If you'd like to help out by organising an event but
would feel more comfortable doing it with someone else who has previously organised events, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/organiser_buddy.md)
and submit an email with your information and one of the organisers will get in touch to help you figure out which event you could help organise.

### Photo policy

We want to get more queer coders excited about us! What better way to show them than by having some photos up so they can see what it’s like at our meetups. We will dedicate one person for the next few meetups to take some photos.

We have a special marker for nametags if you are okay with being in photos (this is an opt-in system).

If you are in one of our published photos and you are not happy, please feel free to tell the organisers and we will stop using it. This is our first photo policy and we are open to feedback on how to improve it!

### Thanks to our sponsors

We want to say thank you to MOO, TechHub, Makers Academy, Pivotal Labs, and uSwitch for hosting us, and providing the space and food/drinks for our meetups.
Thanks also to JetBrains for providing us with IDE licenses to raffle at our events.
