### Upcoming events

Our next event will be [Mob programming](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/240034771/), tomorrow **7th June**. Come along to this event to have a go at mob programming, in which teams of people code all together – think of it as extreme pairing! We'll mix the groups up so each group has a range of people at different levels. This event is open to allies.

Our next [Lunch & Code](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/240134700/) will be this Saturday, **10th June**. In previous sessions we introduced basic TDD concepts. This session builds on those by showing how 'test doubles' can help us specify object interactions – an absolute necessity for anything but the simplest of applications! Please note this Lunch & Code has a later start than normal!

We also have a visit to see the exhibition [Queer British Art 1861-1967](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/queer-british-art-1861-1967) in the works for **24th June**, so save the date and stay tuned for more details!

### Help wanted!

We could use some help in running this meetup. If any of the following interests you, please contact us:

- **Social Media** – promoting via Facebook or Twitter, designing a logo
- **Events** – giving a talk, recommending a speaker, discussion topic ideas, lightning talks of just a few minutes
- **Social events** – finding locations, coming up with ideas, hosting and welcoming people
- **Sponsors** – companies who can provide space and/or sponsor food and drink or social events, we would need someone from the company to be at each event they host

If you want to help out with something else that is not listed, let us know!

### Welfare

Please get in touch with Sam (@onlyskin on Slack) if you have any issues / concerns / anxiety about anything to do with Queer Code London that you’d like to raise safely and/or privately with the group or organisers.

### Buddy Scheme

We run a buddy scheme. This is available to anyone who wants to come to an event and would feel more comfortable meeting someone friendly before the event. If you would like to use the buddy scheme, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/buddy.md) and submit an email with the specified information. We will do our best to arrange someone to meet with you before the event.

### Photo policy

We want to get more queer coders excited about us! What better way to show them than by having some photos up so they can see what it’s like at our meetups. We will dedicate one person for the next few meetups to take some photos.

We have a special marker for nametags if you are okay with being in photos (this is an opt-in system).

If you are in one of our published photos and you are not happy, please feel free to tell the organisers and we will stop using it. This is our first photo policy and we are open to feedback on how to improve it!

### Thanks to our sponsors

We want to say thank you to Gamesys and 8th Light for hosting us this month, and providing the space and food/drinks for our meetups. Thanks also to JetBrains for providing us with IDE licenses to raffle at our events.

We get a few free JetBrains IDE licenses each month to raffle at our events. These can be redeemed for IDEs such as IntelliJ, Resharper or RubyMine which usually cost a couple hundred pounds. Since we weren't able to raffle all of them at our latest events, we have a few left. Please message Franzi on meetup if you're interested in one of them (first come first served).
