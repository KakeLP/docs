### News!

#### Buddy Scheme

We are starting a buddy scheme. This is available to anyone who wants to come to an event and would feel more comfortable meeting someone friendly before the event. If you would like to use the buddy scheme, please visit our [github page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/buddy.md) and submit an email. We will do our best to arrange someone to meet with you before the event!

#### Coding project

We're really pleased to announce that we have birthed our first project – sodan! ([https://github.com/qcldn/sodan](https://github.com/qcldn/sodan))

Sodan is an 'open source conversation equalizer', the idea for which was discovered and discussed at a Queer Code event. It is being worked on by regular Queer Code attendees. It's super early days, but do get in touch if you'd like to help out – there is a How to Contribute file on the GitHub project page, and a channel on slack at #sodan.

### Upcoming events

Our next event will be [Lunch & Code: Chrome DevTools Workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/239058818/) on **22nd April**. This Saturday event will feature a morning talk/workshop on using Chrome's built in DevTools given by our very own Googler! As usual there will be food and time for socialising.

Keep an eye on the Queer Code London meetup page, as we'll be announcing our next few events over the coming weeks.

### Help wanted!

We could use some help in running this meetup. If any of the following interests you, please contact us:

- **Social Media** – promoting us on Facebook and/or Twitter
- **Design** – designing a logo
- **Events** – giving a talk, recommending a speaker, discussion topic ideas, lightning talks of just a few minutes
- **Social events** – finding locations, coming up with ideas, hosting and welcoming people
- **Sponsors** – companies who can provide space and/or sponsor food and drink or social events, we would need someone from the company to be at each event they host

If you want to help out with something else that is not listed, let us know!

### Welfare

Please get in touch with Sam (@onlyskin on Slack) if you have any issues / concerns / anxiety about anything to do with Queer Code London that you’d like to raise safely and/or privately with the group or organisers.

### Photo policy

We want to get more queer coders excited about us! What better way to show them than by having some photos up so they can see what it’s like at our meetups. We will dedicate one person for the next few meetups to take some photos.

We have a special marker for nametags if you are okay with being in photos (this is an opt-in system).

If you are in one of our published photos and you are not happy, please feel free to tell the organisers and we will stop using it. This is our first photo policy and we are open to feedback on how to improve it!

### Thanks to our sponsors

We want to say thank you to 8th Light and Unruly for hosting us this month, and providing the space and food/drinks for our meetups. Thanks also to JetBrains for providing us with IDE licenses to raffle at our events.
