### Pride!

Queer code won't be taking an offical group to pride or marching in the parade, but we encourage everyone to join the Slack channel #pride where people who are interested in getting a group together for pride are able to organise and find each other on the day. You can join the Slack at [https://slackinvite-qcldn.herokuapp.com/](https://slackinvite-qcldn.herokuapp.com/).

### Upcoming events

Our next event is next Monday, 3rd July in the morning at Pivotal Labs in Old Street, [London Pride Celebrations Breakfast](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/240813075/)! This is our first ever breakfast event and we hope to see some new faces! The event will run from 7:30 am until 9:00 am – feel free to drop in for however long you feel like! A group will likely continue to hang out from 9:00 am in a cafe nearby, so if you can't make it before then, post on Slack/meetup and we can let you know where we are!

We have a second event the day after – Tuesday, 4th July in the evening at ThoughtWorks! It will be [Dinner & Code with Alex Dytrych - Teaching Tech](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/240203532/), with food provided by ThoughtWorks. We'll have a talk on teaching in tech from Alex Dytrych, freelance programmer, educator, and designer. The talk will look at some basic teaching skills, as well as discussing why it's important that we as queer people teach others.

### Help wanted!

We could use some help in running this meetup. If any of the following interests you, please contact us:

- **Social Media** – promoting via Facebook or Twitter, designing a logo
- **Events** – giving a talk, recommending a speaker, discussion topic ideas, lightning talks of just a few minutes
- **Social events** – finding locations, coming up with ideas, hosting and welcoming people
- **Sponsors** – companies who can provide space and/or sponsor food and drink or social events, we would need someone from the company to be at each event they host

If you want to help out with something else that is not listed, let us know!

### Welfare

Please get in touch with Sam (@onlyskin on Slack) if you have any issues / concerns / anxiety about anything to do with Queer Code London that you’d like to raise safely and/or privately with the group or organisers.

### Buddy Scheme

We run a buddy scheme. This is available to anyone who wants to come to an event and would feel more comfortable meeting someone friendly before the event. If you would like to use the buddy scheme, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/buddy.md) and submit an email with the specified information. We will do our best to arrange someone to meet with you before the event.

### Photo policy

We want to get more queer coders excited about us! What better way to show them than by having some photos up so they can see what it’s like at our meetups. We will dedicate one person for the next few meetups to take some photos.

We have a special marker for nametags if you are okay with being in photos (this is an opt-in system).

If you are in one of our published photos and you are not happy, please feel free to tell the organisers and we will stop using it. This is our first photo policy and we are open to feedback on how to improve it!

### Thanks to our sponsors

We want to say thank you to Pivotal Labs and ThoughtWorks for hosting us, and providing the space and food/drinks for our meetups. Thanks also to JetBrains for providing us with IDE licenses to raffle at our events.
