### News!

#### Lunch & Code – venue change

We have a new venue for this month's Lunch & Code (next Saturday 19th August)! We will now be hosted by uSwitch, which is much more accessible.

Accessibility information is as follows:

Address: ZPG PLC, The Cooperage, 5 Copper Row, London, SE1 2LH

The building is located in a large square. It can be a little difficult to find. The building has a large glass front and a large purple sign reading "ZPG".

Come to Copper Row via Lafone Street to have access to a ramp to the building. It's easy to miss but it definitely exists! This will also negate the need to use stairs to get up to the entrance.

If you come from another direction (Copper Row via Horselydown Lane), there are a small set of stairs leading to the large glassy front door.

Although there is a small lift to get up the 8 or so stairs from the outside of the building to the front entrance, we cannot guarantee its use on the day.

We'll be in the Cafe area on the first floor. There are lifts inside the building to get up there, as well as a staircase.

#### Bites & Bytes

We have renamed our monthly Dinner & Code events to the much snappier (and punnier) Bites & Bytes – it's still the same format but we like this name better!

#### Lightning talks!

We're planning a new event that we haven't done before – an evening of lightning talks. Lightning talks are short conference-style talks, roughly 5-15 mins in length. The format can be slides, flip-chart or just speaking. The event date has been set for 28th September and we'll be at Makers Academy!

We'd love anyone who has something to share, and/or wants to get some practise of public speaking in a super chill and queer-friendly environment to have a go!

There's no pressure to speak if you don't want to, please feel free to come to the event even if you don't want to give a lightning talk.

If you're considering speaking or are unsure whether to take part, we'll be doing some group coaching sessions at the next couple of events, so feel free to get involved.

Here are some ideas for talks you could do:

• your current project at work

• something you recently learned

• diversity & inclusion topics

• personal experience reports

#### Global day of coderetreat!

We have an event in the works in collaboration with [Ladies of Code](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/) for global day of coderetreat – on Saturday 18th November. More details to be released nearer the date, but it'll be a whole day event, so save the date!

### Upcoming events

Our next event is next Saturday, 19th August. It is our regular [Lunch & Code](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/241463229/), this time with a talk on Making WebVR games by one of our members, Uve. Please note that the Lunch & Code is at a new venue this month – uSwitch! This event is much more accessible, please see the News section above for exact details on accessibility.

On Friday 8th December, we have our third [Boardgames Social](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/242489233/)! Also in a different venue to the past events - this time in Loading Bar in Stoke Newington. There is step-free access to the ground floor, and 15 steps down to the basement.

There are two save-the-date announcements, one for Sunday 24th September for a trip in the works to CaBiRet, a free entry bisexual cabaret night at the Cavendish Arms in Stockwell. Our second save-the-date is for Monday 25th September for our second Queer Coworking daytime event.

Later the same week we have our first ever Lightning Talks event on Thursday 28th September – '[Rainbows & Lightning](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/242437220/)'! This is going to be a great opportunity for anyone who has something to share and/or who wants to practise public speaking in a safer space as lightning talks can be as short as 5 minutes. There's no pressure to do a talk, feel free to attend as just an audience member. At our next few events We will also be practising and coaching people who are interested in doing a lightning talk, so get involved if you'd like to. For more information see details above in News.

Finally, there is one last save-the-date for Saturday 18th November – global day of coderetreat. There is an event in the works in collaboration with [Ladies of Code](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/) for a full day event.

### Help wanted!

We would love more people to get involved in organising events with Queer Code London! A great way to get involved is just by joining the #organisation channel in [our slack](https://slackinvite-qcldn.herokuapp.com/). We have weekly virtual chat meetings at 18:30 every Wednesday, so please feel free to join the channel just to lurk and see what's going on.

If you'd like to organise a new type of event that is also very welcome! We're Queer Coders but sometimes we need a break from coding. Do you wish there was a knitting hangout? A visit to a museum? A hiking trip?? Please don't hesitate to organise or suggest something outside the box!

We understand everyone's time/spoon availability varies a lot – we'd like to emphasise that we will never expect anyone to organise an event just because they have organised it in the past. If you'd like to organise or help out, please feel free to do it on a one off basis.

There are also other ways you can help with Queer Code London:

- **Social Media** – promoting via Facebook or Twitter, designing a logo
- **Events** – giving a talk, recommending a speaker, discussion topic ideas, lightning talks of just a few minutes
- **Social events** – finding locations, coming up with ideas, hosting and welcoming people
- **Sponsors** – companies who can provide space and/or sponsor food and drink or social events, we would need someone from the company to be at each event they host
- **Buddy Volunteers** – we're always looking for people happy to be buddies to new members, if you'd like to volunteer, read our criteria [here](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/buddy.md), and join #buddy-scheme on [Slack](https://slackinvite-qcldn.herokuapp.com/)!
- **Website & Branding** – we're working on improving our website and branding. If that's something you'd like to help with, please join #website or #branding on [Slack](https://slackinvite-qcldn.herokuapp.com/)

If you want to help out with something else that is not listed, let us know!

### Welfare

Please get in touch with Sam (@onlyskin on Slack) if you have any issues / concerns / anxiety about anything to do with Queer Code London that you’d like to raise safely and/or privately with the group or organisers.

### Buddy Scheme

We run a buddy scheme. This is available to anyone who wants to come to an event and would feel more comfortable meeting someone friendly before the event. If you would like to use the buddy scheme, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/buddy.md) and submit an email with the specified information. We will do our best to arrange someone to meet with you before the event.

### Photo policy

We want to get more queer coders excited about us! What better way to show them than by having some photos up so they can see what it’s like at our meetups. We will dedicate one person for the next few meetups to take some photos.

We have a special marker for nametags if you are okay with being in photos (this is an opt-in system).

If you are in one of our published photos and you are not happy, please feel free to tell the organisers and we will stop using it. This is our first photo policy and we are open to feedback on how to improve it!

### Thanks to our sponsors

We want to say thank you to Pivotal Labs, Huckletree, ThoughtWorks, and uSwitch for hosting us this month, and thanks in advance to Makers Academy and TechHub for hosting our upcoming events next month. Thanks also to JetBrains for providing us with IDE licenses to raffle at our events.
