# New to our events?
Hey, weâ€™d love to provide you with a buddy to help you feel welcome at your first event.

To get one, please send an email to **qclnd-orga@googlegroups.com** with the following information:

- name
- pronouns
- contact email or phone number
- which event you would like a buddy for
- at what time you would like to meet before the event (up to 30 minutes before)
- where you prefer to meet (e.g. in a cafe, outside or inside a tube station close to the venue)

Thanks,

Queer Code London

# Would you like to volunteer to be a buddy for a new attendee?
Thank you very much, we rely on volunteers to keep this going!
Please join the #buddy-scheme channel on our [Slack](https://slackinvite-qcldn.herokuapp.com/). We're looking for people who
- commit to attending a meetup 
- are prepared to meet new members before the event starts and walk to the venue together
- will try and help new members to feel welcome during the meetup
